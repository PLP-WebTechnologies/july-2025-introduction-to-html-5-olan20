            <h2 id="about-heading">About Me</h2>
            <p>I have always been a curious kid, who was interested in how things worked. I have also been interested in saving lives and making the world a better place. Cringe, I know. However, that had always been my goal, so biomedical engineering seems liked the perfect career path for me. Now, I am a biomedical engineer who is interested in exploring the intersection of technology, especially AI and machine learning in healthcare.</p>

            <h2 id="goals-heading">My Dreams</h2>
            <p>I want to use AI to create better, low-cost diagnostics and imaging tools for hospitals in places like Nigeria. My big goal is to make healthcare accessible for everyone, no matter where they are.</p>
